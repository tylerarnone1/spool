my wire Frame https://wireframe.cc/keNhH1

My project is called Spool. Its going to be  like  a cross between stack overflow and tumbler. The point of it is to create a feed full of user ideas for projects or functions. then other users can add additional lines of codes called threads that get added to the spool. The end goal is to 'sew' together a working program or function that is 100% crowd sourced.
